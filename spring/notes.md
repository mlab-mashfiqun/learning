- **July 9**: Practiced some Java problems to clear up concepts which can be found in the "Java Problems" directory.
- **July 10**: To get the big picture of Java web programming I learned how to write a simple web-app with an embedded tomcat and the servlet API. This showed me how to shade my Maven project and how to build .jar files. Apart from that I learned how to write basic String based HTML and JSON via the servlet API and handing JSON with the Jackson 3rd party dependency. I sneak peeked into dependency injection by handling dependencies manually - active and passive dependency injection.
On top of that I learned how to add Spring to a project with a single dependency, created my first ApplicationContextConfiguration with @Configuration and @Bean annotations. Other than that I saw how @Beans are singletons by defualt and how to change their scope (prototype). I also used @Component, @ComponentScan and learned about different types of DI (Constructor, Field, Setter). Also learned about profiles and how it can affect specific application.properties files.
I also learned about Spring MVC, replaced my HttpServlet with DispatcherServlet, learned about @RestControllers, handled content negotiation, learned about various ways of accepting request params, path variables and request bodies. Finally, I learned how to validate beans or parameters while changing exceptions with RestControllerAdvice.

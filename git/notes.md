To refresh and extend my git skills, I completed the 7 hour Git Fundamentals course offered by datacamp where I learned to:

- Initialize git repositories using `git init`
- Add files using `git add`
- Commit files using `git commit -m "commit message"`
- Fetching information with `git fetch`
- Checking logs with `git log`
- Checking staged changes using `git status`
- Branching with `git branch`
- Switching branches/worktrees with `git switch` and `git checkout`
- Merging branches using `git merge`
- Managing commits and repositories with `git revert` and `git reset`
- Rebasing with `git rebase`
- Cherry picking with `git cherry-pick`
- Using worktrees with `git worktree`
- Using submodules with `git submodules`
- Trunk Based Development

Afterwards I completed the 9 hour GitHub Fundamentals course (includes some content from Git Fundamentals course) which included regular day-to-day as well as advanced concepts like:

- Creating and cloning repositories
- Managing collaborators
- Issues, Pull requests, Reviews
- Github Projects, Actions, Insights
- Administration and authorization
- Roles, Access tokens, security practices
